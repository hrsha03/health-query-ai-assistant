Dizziness

Dizziness is a term that is often used to describe two different symptoms: lightheadedness and vertigo.

Lightheadedness is a feeling that you might faint.

Vertigo is a feeling that you are spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around you.

Considerations:
Most causes of dizziness are not serious, and they either quickly get better on their own or are easy to treat.
