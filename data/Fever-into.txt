Fever

Fever is the temporary increase in the body's temperature in response to a disease or illness.

A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels:
- 100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)
- 99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)
- 99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)

An adult probably has a fever when the temperature measured in the mouth is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.

Considerations:
Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature include:
- A woman's menstrual cycle
- Physical activity, emotion, eating, clothing, medicines, room temperature, and humidity

Fever is a defense mechanism. Most bacteria and viruses thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Brain damage from fever generally does not occur unless it goes over 107.6°F (42°C).

Febrile seizures can occur in children but usually don't cause permanent harm. Long-lasting unexplained fevers are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).
