Heart or blood vessel problems that can cause chest pain include:

- Angina or a heart attack: Chest pain may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. It may spread to the arm, shoulder, jaw, or back.
- Aortic dissection: A tear in the wall of the aorta causes sudden, severe pain in the chest and upper back.
- Pericarditis: Inflammation in the sac around the heart causes pain in the center part of the chest.
