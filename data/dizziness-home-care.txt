Dizziness Home Care

If you tend to get lightheaded when you stand up:
- Avoid sudden changes in posture.
- Rise slowly from a lying position and sit for a few moments before standing.
- When standing, ensure you have something to hold onto for support.

If you have vertigo:
- Keep still and rest when symptoms occur.
- Avoid sudden movements or rapid position changes.
- Gradually increase activity levels.
- You may need a cane or other assistance during a vertigo attack.
- Avoid bright lights, TV, and reading during attacks as these may worsen symptoms.
- Avoid activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, or climbing until at least one week after symptoms have resolved.
