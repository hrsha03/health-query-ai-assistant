Fever Home Care

High fevers (102°F–104°F / 38.9°C–40°C) from simple colds or viral infections do not always mean serious illness.

If mild and without other symptoms:
- Drink fluids, rest

Signs illness is likely not serious (in children):
- Playing, eating, drinking, alert, normal skin color, looks well when fever goes down

When to reduce fever:
- If uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or not sleeping well

Steps to lower a fever:
- Do not overdress; remove excess clothing
- Keep room comfortable; use one light layer
- Lukewarm baths can help after giving medicine
- Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs

Medicines:
- Acetaminophen: every 4–6 hrs
- Ibuprofen: every 6–8 hrs (not for children <6 months)
- Aspirin: only for adults unless advised by provider
- Check dosage based on weight
- For children <3 months: call provider first

Eating and drinking:
- Encourage fluids: water, ice pops, soup, gelatin
- Limit juice/sports drinks in young children
- Eating is okay, but don’t force it
