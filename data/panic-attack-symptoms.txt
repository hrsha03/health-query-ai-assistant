Symptoms

A panic attack begins suddenly and most often peaks within 10 to 20 minutes. Some symptoms may last an hour or more. A panic attack may be mistaken for a heart attack.

People with panic disorder experience at least 4 of the following during an attack:
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Dizziness or faintness
- Fear of dying
- Fear of losing control or impending doom
- Feeling of choking
- Feelings of detachment
- Feelings of unreality
- Nausea or upset stomach
- Numbness or tingling in extremities
- Palpitations or pounding heart
- Shortness of breath or smothering
- Sweating, chills, or hot flashes
- Trembling or shaking

These attacks can lead to lifestyle changes, fear of being alone, or avoiding places where help isnâ€™t readily available. People may misuse substances or experience depression. Panic attacks can occur without a trigger but recalling past attacks can provoke new ones.
