Abdominal Pain Considerations

Almost everyone experiences abdominal pain at some point. It is usually not serious.

Key points:
- Severity of pain doesnâ€™t always reflect seriousness.
- Mild pain can be caused by serious issues (e.g., appendicitis).
- Severe pain can be caused by less serious conditions (e.g., gas, stomach virus).

Pain can be described as:
- **Generalized pain**: In more than half the abdomen (e.g., stomach virus, gas, indigestion).
- **Localized pain**: In one area (e.g., appendix, gallbladder, stomach).
- **Cramp-like pain**: Often from gas, bloating, and followed by diarrhea. Concerning if persistent or with fever/bleeding.
- **Colicky pain**: Sudden, wave-like, and severe (e.g., kidney stones, gallstones).
