Dizziness Causes

Lightheadedness occurs when your brain does not get enough blood. This may occur if:
- You have a sudden drop in blood pressure.
- Your body is dehydrated from vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or other conditions.
- You get up too quickly after sitting or lying down (more common in older people).

Lightheadedness may also occur if you have:
- The flu, low blood sugar, a cold, or allergies.
- Medicines that lower blood pressure.

More serious conditions that can lead to lightheadedness include:
- Heart problems (e.g., heart attack, abnormal heartbeat)
- Stroke
- Bleeding inside the body
- Shock (extreme drop in blood pressure)

Vertigo may be due to:
- Benign positional vertigo (spinning sensation when you move your head)
- Labyrinthitis (a viral infection of the inner ear, often after a cold or flu)
- Meniere disease (a common inner ear problem)

Other causes of lightheadedness or vertigo may include:
- Use of certain medicines
- Stroke
- Multiple sclerosis
- Seizures
- Brain tumor
- Bleeding in the brain
