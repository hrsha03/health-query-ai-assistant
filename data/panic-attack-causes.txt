Causes

The cause is unknown. Genes may play a role. Other family members may have the disorder. But panic disorder often occurs even without a family history.

It is twice as common in women as in men. Symptoms often begin before age 25 but may first occur in the mid-30s. Children can also have panic disorder, though it may not be diagnosed until later.
