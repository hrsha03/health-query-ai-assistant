Treatment

The goal is to improve daily functioning. Best outcomes occur with both medication and talk therapy.

Talk Therapy (CBT) includes:
- Understanding life stressors and distorted thoughts
- Replacing panic-inducing thoughts
- Stress management and relaxation
- Gradual exposure to fears in imagined and real-life situations

Medications:
- SSRIs (first-line treatment)
- SNRIs
- Other antidepressants or anticonvulsants
- Sedatives/hypnotics (used short-term or in acute cases only, not daily)

Lifestyle changes that may help:
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine
- Eat regular meals
- Get enough sleep and exercise
