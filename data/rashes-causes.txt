Rashes Causes

Many rashes are due to dermatitis (skin inflammation). Common types include:

- Contact dermatitis: Triggered by skin contact with:
  - Latex, rubber, elastic
  - Soaps, detergents, cosmetics
  - Dyes, chemicals in clothing
  - Poison ivy, oak, or sumac

- Seborrheic dermatitis: Redness and scaling, especially around:
  - Eyebrows, eyelids, nose, mouth, trunk, behind ears
  - Scalp (dandruff in adults, cradle cap in infants)
  - Aggravated by age, stress, fatigue, oily skin, weather, or alcohol-based products

- Eczema (atopic dermatitis): Red, itchy, scaly rash common in people with allergies/asthma

- Psoriasis: Red, scaly patches on joints/scalp; sometimes itchy; may affect nails

- Impetigo: Bacterial skin infection, common in children. Sores become blisters, then a honey-colored crust

- Shingles: Painful, blistering rash caused by reactivation of the chickenpox virus, affecting one side of the body

Other causes:
- Childhood illnesses: Chickenpox, measles, roseola, rubella, hand-foot-mouth disease, fifth disease, scarlet fever
