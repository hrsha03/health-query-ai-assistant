Nausea Vomiting
What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will:
- Perform a physical exam
- Look for signs of dehydration

They may ask:
- When did vomiting begin? How long/often?
- Does it occur after eating or on an empty stomach?
- Are other symptoms present (e.g., fever, diarrhea)?
- Vomiting blood or coffee-ground-like material?
- Vomiting undigested food?
- When did you last urinate?
- Recent weight loss or travel?
- What medications are you taking?
- Is anyone else sick who ate with you?
- Are you (or could you be) pregnant?
- Do you use marijuana?

Possible tests:
- Blood tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney/liver function)
- Urinalysis
- Imaging (ultrasound or CT scan)

You may require IV fluids or hospital observation, depending on the severity.
