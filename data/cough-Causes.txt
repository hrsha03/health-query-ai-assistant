Home Care

If you have asthma or another chronic lung disease, make sure you are taking medicines prescribed by your health care provider.

Tips to help ease your cough:

- For a dry, tickling cough: try cough drops or hard candy (not for children under age 3).
- Use a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to soothe a dry throat. Maintain your humidifier properly.
- Drink plenty of fluids to help thin mucus.
- Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.

Over-the-counter medicines:

- Guaifenesin helps break up mucus. Drink lots of fluids.
- Decongestants help relieve postnasal drip. Check with your provider if you have high blood pressure.

For children under age 6, consult a provider before giving any over-the-counter cough medicine.

For seasonal allergies:

- Stay indoors when airborne allergens are high.
- Keep windows closed, use air conditioning, and avoid outdoor air intake fans.
- Shower and change clothes after being outside.

For year-round allergies:

- Use dust mite covers for bedding
- Use air purifiers
- Avoid pets with fur and other triggers

Treat the underlying cause as directed by your provider.
